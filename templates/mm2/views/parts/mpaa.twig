    <p><span class="rating">G</span><span class="advisory">General Audiences. All Ages Admitted.</span><br/>A G-rated
        motion picture contains nothing in theme, language, nudity, sex, violence or other matters that, in the view of
        the Rating Board, would offend parents whose younger children view the motion picture. The G rating is not a
        &ldquo;certificate of approval,&rdquo; nor does it signify a &ldquo;children&rsquo;s&rdquo; motion picture. Some
        snippets of language may go beyond polite conversation but they are common everyday expressions. No stronger
        words are present in G-rated motion pictures. Depictions of violence are minimal. No nudity, sex scenes or drug
        use are present in the motion picture.</p>

    <p><span class="rating">PG</span><span class="advisory">Parental Guidance Suggested. Some Material May Not Be Suitable For Children.</span><br/>A
        PG-rated motion picture should be investigated by parents before they let their younger children attend. The PG
        rating indicates, in the view of the Rating Board, that parents may consider some material unsuitable for their
        children, and parents should make that decision. </p>
    <p>The more mature themes in some PG-rated motion pictures may call for parental guidance. There may be some
        profanity and some depictions of violence or brief nudity. But these elements are not deemed so intense as to
        require that parents be strongly cautioned beyond the suggestion of parental guidance. There is no drug use
        content in a PG-rated motion picture.</p>

<div class="rating_wrapper">
    <p><span class="rating">PG-13</span><span class="advisory">Parents Strongly Cautioned. Some Material May Be Inappropriate For Children Under 13.</span><br/>A
        PG-13 rating is a sterner warning by the Rating Board to parents to determine whether their children under age
        13 should view the motion picture, as some material might not be suited for them. A PG-13 motion picture may go
        beyond the PG rating in theme, violence, nudity, sensuality, language, adult activities or other elements, but
        does not reach the restricted R category. The theme of the motion picture by itself will not result in a rating
        greater than PG-13, although depictions of activities related to a mature theme may result in a restricted
        rating for the motion picture. Any drug use will initially require at least a PG-13 rating. More than brief
        nudity will require at least a PG-13 rating, but such nudity in a PG-13 rated motion picture generally will not
        be sexually oriented. There may be depictions of violence in a PG-13 movie, but generally not both realistic and
        extreme or persistent violence. A motion picture&rsquo;s single use of one of the harsher sexually-derived
        words, though only as an expletive, initially requires at least a PG-13 rating. More than one such expletive
        requires an R rating, as must even one of those words used in a sexual context. The Rating Board nevertheless
        may rate such a motion picture PG-13 if, based on a special vote by a two-thirds majority, the Raters feel that
        most American parents would believe that a PG-13 rating is appropriate because of the context or manner in which
        the words are used or because the use of those words in the motion picture is inconspicuous.</p>

    <p><span class="rating">R</span><span class="advisory">Restricted. Children Under 17 Require Accompanying Parent or LEGAL Guardian.</span><br/>An
        R-rated motion picture, in the view of the Rating Board, contains some adult material. An R-rated motion picture
        may include adult themes, adult activity, hard language, intense or persistent violence, sexually-oriented
        nudity, drug abuse or other elements, so that parents are counseled to take this rating very seriously. Children
        under 17 are not allowed to attend R-rated motion pictures unaccompanied by a parent or adult guardian. Parents
        are strongly urged to find out more about R-rated motion pictures in determining their suitability for their
        children. Generally, it is not appropriate for parents to bring their young children with them to R-rated motion
        pictures.</p>

<div class="rating_wrapper">
    <p><span class="rating">NC-17</span><span class="advisory">No one 17 and Under Admitted.</span><br/>An NC-17 rated
        motion picture is one that, in the view of the Rating Board, most parents would consider patently too adult for
        their children 17 and under. No children will be admitted. NC-17 does not mean &ldquo;obscene&rdquo; or &ldquo;pornographic&rdquo;
        in the common or legal meaning of those words, and should not be construed as a negative judgment in any sense.
        The rating simply signals that the content is appropriate only for an adult audience. An NC-17 rating can be
        based on violence, sex, aberrational behavior, drug abuse or any other element that most parents would consider
        too strong and therefore off-limits for viewing by their children.</p>
